# HCA-Former: A Context-Aware Transformer for Adaptive Thermal Comfort Prediction

## This is a Tensorflow implementation of the following paper:
Sundas Sarwar, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin, Lars Arne Jordanger, Daniela Annunziata, Francesco Piccialli

## 🔍 Overview

**HCA-Former** introduces a novel **Hierarchical Context Attention (HCA)** framework that leverages multisource contextual data (such as environmental, geographic, building, and seasonal features) with a transformer-based architecture for **accurate and adaptive thermal comfort prediction** in smart building environments.

Traditional models like PMV and adaptive comfort models often assume static environments and fail to integrate dynamic contextual variables. HCA-Former overcomes these limitations through:

- A **hierarchical attention mechanism** to prioritize relevant contextual layers.
- A **Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)** module to capture interdependencies among comfort-related features.
- **Robust performance** validated using ROC analysis and confusion matrix evaluation.
